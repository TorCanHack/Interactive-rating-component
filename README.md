## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

It was interesting solving this challenge. I learned how to switch states after submitting a rating. I used the onclick attribute to include my function into the html and then I manipulated the DOM using the query selector, that toggled display for one state and hide the display for another.
